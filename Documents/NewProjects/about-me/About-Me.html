    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I build websites. As a former chemistry teacher, I'm still passionate about making <strong>science</strong> more <strong>accessible</strong> to the public. Science concepts can be explained (and more appreciated) effectively by talking about them
      in the context of the current world we live in. For exammple, why is it a big deal that the temperature of Earth's oceans has risen by about 1 &#8451? It's only 1 &#8451, right?</p>
    <p>The key is to show the relevance of chemistry, biology, and physics to our everyday lives. They can't be relegated to a textbook, where they're associated with dry lectures for high school and college students. Whether you're 8 or 80, you can challenge
      the status quo in any field -- thinking "outside the box" is the only way to move forward in life. You have the power to positively contribute to our planet. Technology might be the most efficient tool for this.</p>
    <p>How? What if there was an app that shows you the content of your drinking water (Flint, anyone?), and that app connected you to your local House representative to report it? </p>
    <p>I also debate on a daily basis whether I should give up coffee. There are pros on both sides!</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I'm <em>from</em> the great city of McAllen, Texas in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley. I was born in Dallas, and lived in McAllen starting at the age of 9. My parents emigrated from Iran in the 1970s, so growing up in a predominantly Hispanic region
      with Iranian parents is a unique experience that I'm very grateful for.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What's most important to you?</h2>
    <p>My family and health are most important to me. I love hiking the hills of LA -- it sets my outlook for the day.</p>
    <h2>What are your goals?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make science more accessible to the general public.</li>
      <li>Changing the language around how we discuss Global Warming ("climate change" sounds harmless).</li>
      <li>Attract people from all fields to practice small changes in their lives in order to limit their carbon footprint.</li>
      <li>Use sheer force of public attention to effect <strong>significant</strong> legislative action across the globe.</li>
    </ul>
